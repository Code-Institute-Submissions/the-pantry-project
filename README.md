# UX - (User Experience)
### Aim of the Project:
The aim of this project was to create a static website to promote a fictional restaurant. 
The aim was to create a visually appealing website which would allow users to find out more information about the restaurant and allow them to find information about the restaurant,
 it's menus, it's history, reviews and use the online forms to book tables and leave their own comments.
### User Stories:
* First-time users:
 1. As a first time user I would want to be greeted with a welcoming home page that is inviting and visually appealing.
 2. I want immediate access to information about the restaurant, booking and opening times.
 3.	I want to be able to read reviews and find information on services provided
 4.	I want the option to view menus online or download the menu to view offline
* Return users:
 1.	I would like access to booking to be quick and easy
 2.	I would like to be given access to information on any changes in the restaurant and menu changes
 3.	Possibility to add reviews to the site?
 4.	Information on events and updates, potential to sign up to newsletter?
* Site Owner:
 1. To provide information about the restaurant
 2. To promote the restaurant as a brand
 3. To allow customers to book through the website
 4. To allow the use of a newsletter format to provide additional information
### Design:
  * Fonts:
The fonts I have chosen to use for this project are 'Kaushan Script' and 'Open Sans'.
'Sans-serif' and 'cursive' are my alternative fallbacks.
I chose those fonts as they are complimentary of each other. Open Sans is the primary font used throughout the project. I felt that the font gives a professional look as well as offering a nice design, the spacing is naturally quite good as required very little in terms of styling, as well as being a good block text which allows for easy reading and doesn't confuse the user with difficult to read font.
The secondary font is Kaushan Script, I felt that for the logo and titles of the page they needed something with a little more flair and it was the perfect choice as it was visually more attractive and it added a rythmn to the logo and page titles open sans wouldn't have been able to produce.
The choice of Open sans and Kaushan in styling was bolstered by the fact that my default fonts for the page aren't too disimilar in terms of styling, and so I feel if there is a problem in loading the fonts for any reason then the styling off the project will still remain intact.

  * Color:
  Primary - #042724D
  Secondary - #363636
  Supplementary - #000
  Supplementary - #fff

  The primary color chosen is a dark forest green, this color makes up the majority of the color styling for the page, i chose this colour as I feel it was pleasing visually as well as creating a nice contrast against white elements and images on the page.
  The majority of elements feature some element of a white background as I wanted the colors to stand out from one another and add an air of professionalism to the project. I felt that the white also helped to create the best contrast for the logo image to help it really stand out against the white background.
  Supplementary colors were then used for the fonts and backgrounds to give visual impact, and give an ease to the user when reading information.
  I felt these were all complimentary colors and fit the themeing of the project aim to give a very natural feeling to the page to work with the natural imagery of the restaurant interiors.

* Logo and Icons:
  All the icons I used in the project are from font awesome. I felt that the block style of social media icons were a better fit in the footer of the page as they fit into the grid style layout of the page.
  I felt that having icons in places was more appropriate than images as they give the visual impact of an image without the necessity to add more files to the repository. The icons are also very easily styled and sized to fit into the project nicely.

  The logo for the page I created myself using Gimp and a png file included in my credited section. The image is supposed to represent the roof of a house or farm style barn to incorporate the over-all theme of restaurant into the brand image.
  The fonts and colouring used in the logo are all incorporated into the color scheme of the page and I just felt it added to the project to give it a branded identity.
