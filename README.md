# UX - (User Experience)
### Aim of the Project:
The aim of this project was to create a static website to promote a fictional restaurant. 
The aim was to create a visually appealing website which would allow users to find out more information about the restaurant and allow them to find information about the restaurant,
 it's menus, it's history, reviews and use the online forms to book tables and leave their own comments.

 2. I want immediate access to information about the restaurant, booking and opening times.
 3.	I want to be able to read reviews and find information on services provided
 4.	I want the option to view menus online or download the menu to view offline
* Return users:
 1.	I would like access to booking to be quick and easy
 2.	I would like to be given access to information on any changes in the restaurant and menu changes
 3.	Possibility to add reviews to the site?
 4.	Information on events and updates, potential to sign up to newsletter?
* Site Owner:
