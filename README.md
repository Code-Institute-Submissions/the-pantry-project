# UX - (User Experience)
### Aim of the Project:
The aim of this project was to create a static website to promote a fictional restaurant. 
The aim was to create a visually appealing website which would allow users to find out more information about the restaurant and allow them to find information about the restaurant,
 it's menus, it's history, reviews and use the online forms to book tables and leave their own comments.
### User Stories:
* First-time users:
 1. As a first time user I would want to be greeted with a welcoming home page that is inviting and visually appealing.
 2. I want immediate access to information about the restaurant, booking and opening times.
 3.	I want to be able to read reviews and find information on services provided
 4.	I want the option to view menus online or download the menu to view offline
* Return users:
 1.	I would like access to booking to be quick and easy
 2.	I would like to be given access to information on any changes in the restaurant and menu changes
 3.	Possibility to add reviews to the site?
 4.	Information on events and updates, potential to sign up to newsletter?
* Site Owner:
 1. To provide information about the restaurant
 2. To promote the restaurant as a brand
 3. To allow customers to book through the website
 4. To allow the use of a newsletter format to provide additional information
### Design:
  * Fonts:
The fonts I have chosen to use for this project are 'Kaushan Script' and 'Open Sans'.
'Sans-serif' and 'cursive' are my alternative fallbacks.
I chose those fonts as they are complimentary of each other. Open Sans is the primary font used throughout the project. I felt that the font gives a professional look as well as offering a nice design, the spacing is naturally quite good as required very little in terms of styling, as well as being a good block text which allows for easy reading and doesn't confuse the user with difficult to read font.
The secondary font is Kaushan Script, I felt that for the logo and titles of the page they needed something with a little more flair and it was the perfect choice as it was visually more attractive and it added a rythmn to the logo and page titles open sans wouldn't have been able to produce.
The choice of Open sans and Kaushan in styling was bolstered by the fact that my default fonts for the page aren't too disimilar in terms of styling, and so I feel if there is a problem in loading the fonts for any reason then the styling off the project will still remain intact.

  * Color:
  Primary - #042724D
  Secondary - #363636
  Supplementary - #000
  Supplementary - #fff

  The primary color chosen is a dark forest green, this color makes up the majority of the color styling for the page.
